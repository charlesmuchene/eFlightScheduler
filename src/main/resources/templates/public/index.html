			<p>In a commercial airline, the flight schedule is a focal point of the planning process. It is aimed at optimizing 
			the deployment of the airline&rsquo;s resources to meet the demand and maximize profits. Having an effective and 
			efficient resource management system like scheduling system for flight has a big role in increasing companies' 
			profit revenue and satisfying customer&rsquo;s demand on spot.  <br/>Recognizing the central nature of the schedule, 
			or professionals both within and outside of airlines have been on the development of methods for obtaining optimal 
			schedule since the 1950s. The work has been discussed extensively in symposium and study group meetings of 
			AGIFROS (Airline group of the international federation of Operational Research Society) kindred 
			of the society of IFORS and at other professional society meetings. Much of the early works were on a 
			model which can readily be formulated mathematically and solved by standard optimization algorithms. <br/>
			In a modern era, the technologies must match with customer's demand, especially on such management systems. 
			Now a day's people are global citizens and work from place to place, for them to move, the preferred means of 
			transportation is an airline industry. This industry must be modern and feature with technology for the people 
			to uses as a delicate means of getting way to their works and purposes. The reason for building a flight schedule 
			is to make the process smooth and comfortable and determine a concurrent flow for the passengers, cargo and aircraft. </p>
